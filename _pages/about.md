My name is Ali Lashini. I recently graduated with a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). During my master's degree, my focus was primarily on computer vision and image processing. For my thesis, I delved into the fascinating world of lip reading and audio-visual speech recognition. 

I find working with various types of data to be incredibly rewarding, especially when it comes to visual and medical data. I also take great pleasure in developing deep learning algorithms to uncover valuable insights from these diverse datasets.
