My name is Ali Lashini. I recently graduated with a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). During my master's degree, I worked mostly on computer vision and image prossessing. Also, for my thesis, I focused on Lip Reading and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition.
I enjoy working with different types of data, particularly visual and medical data. Also, I love to develop deep learning algorithms to learn and understand these data.
